# kubernetes-tutorial

A simple guide for running a local kubernetes cluster (using minikube), dockerizing and deploying a simple web application.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the following tools are installed on the system:
- [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), for running a local kubernetes (k8s) cluster.
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/), for creating a containerized application.
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), version 8+, for running the sample application.

Any application that can be dockerized can be used for this tutorial, as long as the docker image is available.
